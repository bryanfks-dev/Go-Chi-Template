# CMD DIRECTORY

This directory contains the main entry point for the Go application. It includes the `main.go` file which initializes and starts a command.

To run command, navigate the root directory and execute the following command:

```bash
go run ./cmd/{command_name}
```

Replace `{command_name}` with the actual name of the command file if there are multiple commands.

Make sure to have all necessary dependencies installed and configured before running the application.
